# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The build number (`CFBundleVersion`) is auto-incremented on every build by
a scheme post-action (`agvtool bump`) and is not tracked here.

## [1.3] — 2026-07-24

### Added


- **Chemical equations.** Math written with `\ce{…}` — the chemistry
  notation from `mhchem` — now typesets as proper chemistry: `$\ce{H2SO4 + 2
  OH- -> SO4^2- + 2 H2O}$` sets its subscripts, charges and reaction arrow
  the way a textbook would, and `\pu{…}` formats physical units. It works
  anywhere math already does — inline `$…$`, display `$$…$$`, a ` ```math `
  block — in the preview, in print, in an exported PDF and, because it is
  math, in an exported EPUB. It draws **on-device** from `mhchem.min.js`
  (the `mhchem` extension from the same **KaTeX 0.17.0** build the app
  already carries, MIT-licensed), so it adds no network use and only ~33 KB,
  loaded only when a document actually contains a formula.
- **Syntax highlighting.** A fenced code block that names its language —
  ` ```swift `, ` ```js `, ` ```python ` and the like — now reads with its
  keywords, comments and strings set apart, so a snippet is easier to follow
  without turning into a coloured jumble. The theme is written to the app's
  own hand rather than borrowed: keywords take the warm accent, comments the
  muted ink in italic, strings a quieter shade of the ink, and everything
  else stays plain — three calm tones on the same paper as the prose, in the
  same Courier face, rather than a bright editor palette that would fight the
  page. It draws **on-device** from `highlight.min.js` (the
  "common"-languages build of **highlight.js 11.11.1**, ~124 KB,
  BSD-3-Clause), loaded only when a document actually has code to colour, and
  covers the forty-odd languages that build carries; a fence whose language
  it doesn't know, or a fence with no language at all, is simply left as
  plain code. The colouring shows in the preview, in print, in an exported
  PDF and in an exported HTML page; an exported **EPUB** keeps its code
  plain, since that format is built from the document before any of this
  runs.
- **Graphviz diagrams.** A fenced block tagged `dot`, `graphviz` or `gv` is
  now laid out by **Graphviz**, the classic tool for graphs that are
  described rather than drawn. Each of its layout programs can be named as
  the block's language instead — `neato`, `circo`, `fdp`, `sfdp`, `twopi`,
  `osage` and `patchwork` — so the same graph can be given a hierarchy, a
  spring model, a circle or a radial fan by changing one word. A bare `.gv`
  file opens in md the way a `.puml` file already does — from File ▸ Open,
  the Finder's "Open With", or a double-click — and renders as the diagram
  in the preview, print and exported PDF while the source stays fully
  editable. All of it draws **on-device** from an engine the app has
  carried all along as PlantUML's own back end, so this costs no extra
  download and no network. Graphviz's other usual extension, `.dot`, is
  deliberately left unclaimed — macOS already declares it as a Word
  template — so rename such a file to `.gv` to open it; fenced ` ```dot `
  blocks are unaffected.
- **YAML and TOML front matter.** A file written for a blog, a site
  generator or a notes app almost always opens with a block of metadata —
  title, author, date — fenced off above the text. md used to render that
  opening `---` as a horizontal rule and the metadata under it as stray
  prose, so any such file looked broken the moment it was opened. Both
  conventions are now understood — YAML between `---` lines (closed by
  `---` or `...`) and TOML between `+++` lines — and the block is
  recognised as metadata rather than text and hidden: the page begins at
  the first heading in the preview, in print, in an exported PDF and in an
  exported EPUB alike, in a document window and in a book workspace alike.
  The block stays in the file and is saved back untouched, so whatever else
  you hand the file to still finds it. Its fields are read as plain
  `key: value` (or `key = value`) pairs rather than by a full YAML parser —
  enough for a title and an author; a list or a nested key inside the block
  is passed over rather than understood, and so long as one plain field
  remains beside it the block is still hidden whole. A block that holds no
  recognisable field at all is not metadata and is not treated as such:
  `---`, three bullets and `---` stay
  a rule, a list and a rule, so prose that merely happens to sit between
  two rules is never hidden from the reader. And it only counts at the very
  top of a document, and only when the fence is closed again: a document
  that simply opens with a horizontal rule keeps its rule, and a `---`
  further down is the thematic break it always was.
- **Footnotes.** An aside that would interrupt a sentence can now be sent
  to the foot of the page instead, in the spelling GitHub and Pandoc
  already use. Mark the spot in your text with `[^id]`, and write the note
  itself on a line of its own as `[^id]: the note` — wrapping it over as
  many lines as it needs, and putting it wherever in the file suits you,
  since it never renders where it is written. The notes are gathered under
  a rule at the foot of the rendered page — in the preview, in print, in an
  exported PDF and in an exported EPUB alike, in a document window and in a
  book workspace alike — and numbered: each reference in the text becomes a
  small numbered link down to its note, and each note you cited ends in an
  arrow that takes the reader back to where it was first cited. The
  numbering follows the order a reader meets the references rather than the
  order the notes happen to be written in, so moving a note around the file
  changes nothing on the page. Two kindnesses are deliberate: a reference
  with no note behind it stays exactly the text you typed rather than
  becoming a link that leads nowhere, and a note you wrote but never cited
  is still printed, after the cited ones — nothing you wrote is dropped in
  silence.
- **CSV and TSV blocks draw as tables.** A table of figures usually begins
  life in a spreadsheet, and turning it into Markdown's pipes and dashes by
  hand is the sort of work nobody wants to do twice. Paste the data as it
  comes instead — into a fenced block tagged `csv`, or `tsv` for the
  tab-separated text a spreadsheet puts on the clipboard — and md draws it
  as an ordinary table in the preview, in print, in an exported PDF, in an
  exported HTML file and in an exported EPUB alike, in a document window
  and in a book workspace alike, while the source stays the data it always
  was. That is the point of it: when next month's numbers arrive, the block
  is replaced wholesale with a fresh copy rather than edited cell by cell.
  The first row is the header. Quoting works the way a spreadsheet writes
  it — a field wrapped in quotes may hold a comma or even a line break, a
  doubled quote inside such a field is one literal quote, and a quote that
  opens nothing, the inch mark in `5" pipe`, is simply a character. A
  column whose values are all numbers is lined up on the right, so the
  decimal points sit under one another; a single piece of text in the
  column and it stays left-aligned, as text should be. This is a fenced
  block and nothing more — md still neither opens nor saves `.csv` files.
- **Export as HTML.** A new "Export as HTML…" action in the File menu,
  directly below "Export as PDF…", renders the document and saves it through
  the standard save panel as **one self-contained `.html` file**: a single
  file that opens anywhere — a browser, a phone, a machine that has never
  heard of md — with nothing beside it. No engines, no folder of assets, and
  no engine left in the page to run. The only thing an exported page can
  still reach for is an image you linked to yourself: those are written out
  as the links they were, not fetched and embedded. What is saved is the
  finished page rather than the recipe for one: every Mermaid, Graphviz and
  PlantUML diagram has already been drawn and travels as a drawing, and
  every formula has already been typeset and travels as real text — so a
  reader can copy a formula out of the page, and it stays sharp at any zoom.
  A document with formulas carries the typesetting fonts it needs inside the
  file, and those fonts are most of what it weighs; a document without
  formulas carries none of them and is a few kilobytes. And because an
  exported file is read on a screen rather than on paper, the author's
  `\newpage` markers appear as the dashed rules the preview shows rather
  than as the page breaks the PDF gets.
- **Export as LaTeX.** A new "Export as LaTeX…" action in the File menu,
  directly below "Export as HTML…", writes the document through the
  standard save panel as a `.tex` file. This is the one export where your
  mathematics comes out as mathematics: everything else md produces turns
  a formula into a picture — a PDF page, an EPUB, a printout — or into the
  markup a browser typesets, while a `.tex` file hands it back as the
  `$…$` you typed, ready to paste into a paper and go on editing. The rest
  of the document travels with it: headings become `\section` and its
  deeper relatives, emphasis becomes `\textbf` and `\emph`, lists become
  `itemize` and `enumerate` nested the way you nested them, a table — and
  a `csv` or `tsv` block alike — becomes a `longtable` that keeps your
  column alignment and breaks across pages, repeating its header row, so a
  table longer than a page keeps every row instead of stopping at the one
  that filled it. Code becomes `verbatim`, a quote becomes `quote`, and
  your `\newpage` markers stay the `\newpage` they already look like. An
  image becomes `\includegraphics`, set in a captioned `figure` wherever
  you wrote it in body text and gave it alt text — a graphic as wide as
  the text block has nowhere to stand inside a sentence, so the float is
  left for LaTeX to place; inside a table cell or a footnote there is no
  float to be had, so the graphic goes in bare with your alt text in
  italic beside it. When LaTeX cannot include the picture at all — the
  file name has a character `\includegraphics` reads as something other
  than a name (a `"` among them, since graphicx quotes file names with
  those itself), or the image is a `https://` or `data:` URL, which TeX
  will not fetch — the image is skipped rather than taking the whole
  document down with it, and your alt text is set in its place, with a
  comment naming the file on the line below it. Front matter becomes the
  title block: `title`, `author` and `date` become `\title`, `\author` and
  `\date` with a `\maketitle`. A `[^id]` footnote is written into the text
  at the point you first cited it, which is how LaTeX itself would have
  you write it — a second citation becomes a `\footnotemark` carrying the
  same number, a note first cited from a table's header row has its text
  set just after the table, because LaTeX prints nothing from inside a
  header it repeats on every page, and a note you never cited is printed
  at the end all the same. In a book each article numbers its own notes,
  so two articles that both start at `[^1]` — which is the ordinary way to
  write them — each keep their own note's words. A whole book exports the
  same way, from the Book window's share menu or File ▸ Export Book as
  LaTeX…, as one `book`-class file with each chapter a `\chapter` and each
  article a `\section`, in the order the compiled PDF and the EPUB read
  them. Three things are worth knowing. LaTeX has no renderer for a
  Mermaid, Graphviz or PlantUML diagram, so a diagram's source travels as
  a `verbatim` block under a comment naming its language — kept for you to
  decide what to do with rather than quietly dropped. A display formula
  that is really a multi-line one — a `\\` or an `&` at its own top level,
  with no environment of its own around them — is given an `aligned` so it
  sets where you meant it instead of stopping the compile; and in a table
  cell or a footnote, where LaTeX will not open a display at all, a
  `$$…$$` is set inline rather than being lost. And the preamble asks for
  exactly the packages the document actually uses and no others:
  `graphicx` only if there is an image, `hyperref` only if there is a
  link, `ulem` only for a strikethrough, `longtable` only if there is a
  table, and the T2A font encoding only when the text has Cyrillic in it,
  which the default encoding would otherwise drop without a word — plus
  `amsmath` whenever there is any mathematics at all, since that is where
  `aligned` and its relatives live. So a plain piece of prose comes out
  with a short, clean preamble — and whatever is in it is what your TeX
  installation has to be able to find.
- **The diagram types that were already there.** md has bundled Mermaid and
  PlantUML since 1.1, but the examples only ever showed a flowchart or two,
  so most of what they can draw went unnoticed. The "Diagrams" example
  document now shows the range. Mermaid draws `flowchart`,
  `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `erDiagram`,
  `journey`, `gantt`, `pie`, `quadrantChart`, `requirementDiagram`,
  `gitGraph`, `C4Context`, `mindmap`, `timeline`, `kanban`, `sankey-beta`,
  `xychart-beta`, `block-beta`, `packet-beta`, `architecture-beta`,
  `radar-beta` and `treemap-beta`. PlantUML draws the UML family inside
  `@startuml` — sequence, class, activity, state, component, use case,
  object and deployment — plus the C4 standard library, ArchiMate, timing
  diagrams and even sudoku. Beyond UML it draws a good deal more, each with
  its own opener: `@startmindmap` and `@startwbs` (mind maps and work
  breakdowns), `@startgantt` (schedules), `@startsalt` (interface
  wireframes), `@startjson` and `@startyaml` (data structures),
  `@startebnf` (grammars), `@startregex` (regular expressions as railroad
  diagrams), `@startnwdiag` (networks), `@startchen`
  (entity–relationship), `@startditaa` (ASCII art turned into a drawing),
  and `@startlatex` / `@startmath` (formulas). Nothing was added to the
  app to make these work — they were always there, only undocumented.

- **Open PlantUML files.** `.puml` (and `.plantuml`) documents now open in
  md — from File ▸ Open, the Finder's "Open With", or a double-click. A file
  that is a raw PlantUML diagram (`@startuml … @enduml`, with no code fence)
  renders as the diagram in the preview, print and exported PDF, while the
  source stays fully editable and saves as plain UTF-8 text.
- **Export a single document as EPUB.** A whole book has been able to
  become an EPUB since 1.2; now a single open document can too, from a
  new "Export as EPUB…" command in the File menu, below "Export as HTML…"
  and above "Export as LaTeX…". What a reader opens is not one flat entry
  standing in for the whole file but the document itself, laid out with
  its own headings as the table of contents — the same outline the
  document already lists, in the same order — so every section is
  somewhere the reader can jump to. The title is taken from the front
  matter's `title:` field when the document has one and from the file's
  own name when it does not: a lone document has no folder to borrow a
  name from, so the file name has the last word. Everything the book
  export already does, this does — every formula and every Mermaid,
  Graphviz or PlantUML diagram is drawn once and travels as a picture,
  and it is the same self-contained EPUB — and the identifier is derived
  from that title, so the same document exports as the same publication
  every time, updating the copy a reader already has rather than settling
  in beside it, the same courtesy a book is given just below. There is no
  title page: a single document is its own first page, and the contents
  point at it rather than at a cover.
- **A page size for the PDF.** The PDF export — and the whole-book PDF
  compile — always came out as A4, which suits a printout and little else
  a document is really made into: a booklet wants A5, a reader in the
  States wants US Letter or Legal, and a paperback printed on demand
  wants one of the trim sizes a print service asks for and will not
  accept as A4. So the size is now yours to choose — A4, A5, US Letter,
  US Legal, or the paperback trims 6 × 9″, 5 × 8″ and 5.5 × 8.5″ — from a
  "PDF Page Size" item in the File menu just below "Export as PDF…", the
  one choice governing both the document's PDF and the Book window's,
  where it matters most: a book can be compiled at the very size it will
  be printed at rather than at one no press would take. The choice is
  remembered from one export to the next, and the page's margins scale
  with the paper, so a 6 × 9 page is not left wearing the wide margins A4
  was cut for. A4 stays the default, and an A4 export is unchanged to the
  pixel; the size reaches only the exported or shared PDF and its margins
  — the preview, the HTML export and the EPUB keep their own — and a
  printout to paper is left alone, since a paper proof goes out on
  whatever the printer is holding.
- **Export a diagram as SVG.** A new "Export Diagram as SVG…" submenu in the
  File menu, beside "Export as LaTeX…", lists the document's diagrams — one
  row apiece, named by engine and a line of the source so two of them are
  told apart — and saves the one you choose as a standalone `.svg` file where
  you point the save panel: a real vector drawing that opens in any browser
  or vector editor and stays sharp at any size. Only the three drawing
  engines are offered — **Mermaid**, **Graphviz** and **PlantUML** — since
  those are the blocks that render to vector; math is not among them, because
  KaTeX sets a formula as HTML and text rather than as a drawing, so a
  formula has no vector to hand over and is left off the list. The diagram is
  laid out once through the same offline engines the preview uses and its
  finished vector is written straight out, not a picture taken of it. Mermaid
  draws without stating a height — which would open a standalone file at no
  height at all — so md fills the real width and height in from the drawing's
  own coordinates before it saves; Graphviz and PlantUML already give their
  size and are left untouched. And a diagram whose source never drew — a
  syntax error, say — has no vector to export, so md says as much rather than
  leaving an empty file behind.
- **Open and export TextBundle.** A TextBundle (`.textbundle`) — and its
  zipped form, a TextPack (`.textpack`) — is the Markdown-with-images
  container that Ulysses, iA Writer and Bear write, and md now opens one,
  from File ▸ Open, the Finder's "Open With", or a double-click: the
  `text.md` inside becomes the editable document. A new "Export as
  TextBundle…" action in the File menu, beside "Export as LaTeX…", writes the
  current document back out as one — `text.md`, the small `info.json` the
  format expects, and an `assets/` folder — and this is where images are
  handled. A picture you linked by a plain relative name (`![](photo.png)`,
  the file sitting beside your document) is copied into `assets/` and its
  link rewritten to point there, so the bundle carries the image with it; a
  picture md cannot find, or one linked on the web or embedded inline as
  data, is left exactly as you wrote it — a link that already led nowhere
  stays a visible broken link rather than being quietly dropped. Two limits
  are worth stating plainly. A bundle is imported for editing rather than
  adopted as a file to save back into, because writing only the text into the
  package would drop the `assets/` and `info.json` it carries — so keep the
  work as a Markdown file, or export a fresh bundle. And md's document is only
  its text, and its preview has never shown a local image, so an opened
  bundle's own `assets/` pictures are not displayed: those refs render as the
  broken images they point at while you edit the prose. The round-trip is the
  words; the pictures travel inside the file, not on the page.

### Fixed


- **An exported book keeps its identity.** Every EPUB export was stamped
  with a freshly invented identifier, so as far as a reader was concerned
  each export was a different publication: fix a typo, export again, and
  the new file settled into the library beside the old one instead of
  replacing it — two copies of the same book, and then three. A book's
  identifier is now derived from its title, so the same book exports as the
  same publication however many times you export it, and a reader updates
  the copy it already has. Rename the book and it becomes a new one, which
  is what a new name ought to mean. md's three apps derive it identically,
  so the same book exported from the Mac and from the phone is one
  publication rather than two. Nothing else about the file's metadata
  changed: the export still carries no author and no cover.

## [1.2] — 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Export as PDF.** A dedicated "Export as PDF…" action in the File menu
  renders the document and saves the PDF through the standard save panel,
  alongside the existing share flow.
- **Table of contents.** The new Go menu lists every heading in the
  document (in the book window, also from the toolbar); choosing one jumps
  the preview — and the editor — straight to it. Headings now carry
  GitHub-style anchors, so `[…](#section)` links navigate inside the
  document too.
- **Page breaks.** Write `\newpage` (or `\pagebreak`) on its own line — the
  Pandoc convention — to end a page where *you* decide: shared and exported
  PDFs and printouts start a fresh A4 page there, and the preview shows a
  subtle dashed rule.
- **Private author notes.** `<!-- note: … -->` comments are the writer's
  working notes: the Go menu's "Notes" lists them and jumps to them in
  the editor, and they never appear in the preview, the PDF, or print.
  (Other HTML comments are now dropped from the rendered output as well.)
- **Word and character count.** Every document window — and the book
  window's writing pane — shows the document's live word and character
  count in a footer under the page.
- **Synchronized scrolling in Split.** The editor and the preview scroll
  as one: move either pane and the other follows proportionally — in
  document windows and in the book workspace alike. Jumping to a heading
  from the Contents menu still lands each pane on its precise spot.
- **Writer mode: books.** Create a book from scratch (File ▸ New Book… — one
  save panel names it and chooses where it lives) or open an existing folder
  as one (File ▸ Open Book…): its subfolders are chapters, its Markdown
  files are articles, ordered by numeric filename prefix ("01-intro.md")
  and then alphabetically. The book window (File ▸ Show Book, ⇧⌘B) opens
  any article and creates new chapters and articles in place; the book is
  remembered across launches.
- **Images.** `![alt](url "title")` now renders in the preview, shared and
  exported PDFs, and print — including linked images (`[![…](…)](…)`).
  Links also honour an optional hover title. Images keep their original
  size, capped to the page width.
- **Built-in examples.** A new File ▸ Examples menu opens ready-made
  documents showing everything md can do — formatting, tables, code,
  images, math, diagrams, and the writer tools — each as a fresh untitled
  document of your own to explore and edit. "Example Book…" in the same
  menu unpacks a small sample book to a location you choose and opens it,
  so chapters and articles can be seen in action.
- **Book management.** Right-click any chapter or article in the Book
  window to Rename, Move Up / Move Down, or Delete it. Reordering is
  written back to the filenames — the whole group is renumbered with tidy
  "01-", "02-" prefixes — so the order is real, portable, and visible in
  Finder.
- **Compile a book to PDF.** The Book window's new share menu renders the
  entire book — a title page, then every chapter and article in reading
  order, each starting on a fresh page — through the same PDF pipeline as
  a single document, ready to share or save as "&lt;Book name&gt;.pdf".
- **Export a book as EPUB.** "Export as EPUB…" packages the book as a
  standard EPUB 3 — chapters and articles in reading order with a proper
  table of contents — that opens in Apple Books and other readers. Math
  formulas and Mermaid / PlantUML diagrams are rendered by the app's own
  offline engines and embedded as images, so they display in any reader.
- **The book window is now a writing workspace.** The book's structure sits
  in a compact sidebar and the selected article opens right there, in the
  same Edit / Split / Preview panes as a document window — with its own
  Contents and Notes menus, and a footer showing the article's word and
  character count. Everything autosaves as you write; take the window full
  screen (the green button, ⌃⌘F) for a distraction-free writing room with
  nothing on screen but the book. The workspace reopens on the article you
  last wrote in, a new article opens ready to write, and deleting one moves
  you to its neighbour.
- **Walk the book from the keyboard.** ⌃⌘↑ / ⌃⌘↓ (and toolbar chevrons)
  move to the previous / next article in reading order, and ⌘1 / ⌘2 / ⌘3 in
  the new View-menu commands switch Edit / Split / Preview — in the book
  window and in every document window alike.
- **The whole book, from the File menu.** Share Book as PDF, Export Book
  as PDF…, Export Book as EPUB… and the new Print Book… sit in the File
  menu whenever a book is open — from any window, so shipping the book
  never means leaving the page being written (the in-place editor saves
  itself first). The book window's share menu carries the same actions,
  Print… now included.
- **Articles in windows, if you prefer.** A toggle in the book window's
  share menu — "Open Articles in Separate Windows" — restores the previous
  behavior, where selecting an article opens it as its own document window.
  A double-click or the row's "Open in New Window" does the same on demand
  either way; while an article is open as a document window, that window
  owns the file and the book pane steps aside rather than fighting it over
  saves. If a file ever changes on disk beneath unsaved edits, nothing is
  clobbered silently: the workspace keeps both versions and asks.

### Changed

- **PDFs are real A4 pages.** Shared and exported PDFs come from the same
  engine as printing: A4 pages, paginated line-aware — no line of text or
  diagram sliced at a fold — with `\newpage` starting a fresh page. The
  earlier one-long-page layout (and the "PDF Layout" setting that chose
  between the two) is gone; the continuous page lives on where it belongs,
  in the on-screen preview.
- **Paper is white.** Printouts and PDFs no longer carry the on-screen
  paper tint — the tinted block ended mid-page against the white A4
  margins — and always use the light ink, even from a dark-mode window:
  the whole page is one color, the way a manuscript prints. The preview
  keeps its warm paper and dark theme on screen.
- **The document window lost its toolbar.** The menu bar is the chrome, as
  on a Mac it should be: View ▸ Edit / Split / Preview (⌘1/⌘2/⌘3) switches
  the layout, the new **Go** menu jumps through the book's articles
  (⌃⌘↑/↓) and the document's headings and private notes, and File carries
  the book, share, export and print commands (including the new Close
  Book). The book window keeps its workspace toolbar.
- Printed and exported documents now use a smaller body size (11 pt, down
  from 13 pt) — standard print typography that fits more of the document per
  page — and long code lines wrap instead of being clipped at the code
  block's edge (on screen they scroll; paper can't). The on-screen preview
  is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Full screen works.** Document windows and the book window can now
  actually enter native full screen — the green button, View ▸ Enter Full
  Screen, fn-F. The windows never declared the capability, so the menu
  item sat permanently disabled and the green button only zoomed. Full
  screen on the book window is the distraction-free writing mode: nothing
  on screen but the book.
- **Legacy Cyrillic text files decode correctly.** A Windows-1251 file
  without a byte-order mark could be misread as UTF-16 — mojibake that the
  next autosave would have baked into the file. UTF-16 is now only detected
  by its BOM, so such files open (and round-trip) as the Cyrillic text they
  are.
- **Shared PDFs no longer cut lines.** "Share Rendered PDF" (and the new
  export) paginates with the print engine's line-aware page breaks, so no
  line of text or diagram is ever sliced through the middle at a page
  boundary — the break falls between lines, as printing always did.

## [1.1] — 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Math, Mermaid and PlantUML in the preview.** The rendered preview now draws
  TeX/LaTeX math — `$…$` inline and `$$…$$` display, plus ` ```math ` blocks,
  the way GitHub does — as well as **Mermaid** graphs (` ```mermaid `) and
  **PlantUML** diagrams (` ```plantuml `). Everything renders **on-device** from
  bundled engines: no network, no accounts, nothing leaves your device. The same
  rendering flows through to Print / Save-as-PDF and “share rendered”.

### Changed

- The rendered preview now uses the same HTML/WebKit rendering as Print / PDF /
  share (previously a separate native renderer), so the preview and the exported
  document are pixel-identical.

## [1.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added

- Initial release: a native macOS document-based Markdown editor + live
  previewer, built in SwiftUI on AppKit with no third-party dependencies.
  This is the Mac sibling of the iOS / iPadOS app
  [md](https://github.com/nettrash/md); the two share the Markdown parser,
  renderer and themed HTML export verbatim.
- `DocumentGroup` over a `MarkdownDocument` (`FileDocument`), backed by a
  real `NSDocument` on macOS: open, edit and save `.md` / `.markdown` files
  anywhere via the standard panels, with autosave, versions and the native
  title-bar **Rename / Move To / Duplicate / New**. Plain-text files open
  and round-trip with their original extension. Markdown is declared as an
  imported UTI (`net.daringfireball.markdown`).
- Hand-written block-level Markdown parser and SwiftUI renderer covering
  headings, paragraphs, bullet / ordered / task lists (with nesting),
  fenced code blocks (``` and `~~~`), block quotes (nested), GitHub
  tables with column alignment, and thematic breaks. Inline formatting
  (bold, italic, code, links, strikethrough) is rendered via Foundation's
  `AttributedString(markdown:)`.
- Edit / Split / Preview layout switch as a native segmented control in
  the window toolbar. Split shows the editor and preview side by side and
  re-renders live as you type (stacking vertically when the window is
  dragged narrow). The chosen layout is remembered per window.
- **Typewriter theme.** Warm paper background — "fresh paper" in light
  mode, "carbon paper" in dark — with the American Typewriter face across
  the editor and preview, and Courier New for code. Warm-amber
  `AccentColor` and `PaperBackground` / `PaperBackgroundSecondary` /
  `PaperInk` color sets, all with light and dark variants.
- **`NSTextView`-based editor.** Undo / Redo via the standard macOS
  **Edit** menu; "smart" quote / dash / text substitutions are turned off
  so Markdown punctuation stays literal; every keystroke flows to the
  document, so the system autosave keeps the file current as you type.
- **Print & share.** Print the rendered document and share it as a PDF,
  both rendered through WebKit so the typewriter styling and paper
  background follow the current appearance. The raw Markdown source can be
  shared too — the saved file itself when it exists, otherwise the current
  text. Available from the toolbar and from **File ▸ Print… (⌘P)** and the
  Share menu commands, routed to the frontmost document window.
- **Sandboxed, no network.** App Sandbox with user-selected file access
  only; the app makes no network connections and stores documents only
  where the user puts them.
- App icon: a cream American Typewriter "md" on a dark warm-brown gradient.
- Unit tests (38 cases) covering the Markdown parser — including regression
  coverage for setext headings, wrapped list items, `C#`-style headings,
  tab-indented lists and bounded block-quote nesting — plus the
  `MarkdownHTML` export.
