//
//  TextBundle (`.textbundle`, a directory package) and TextPack
//  (`.textpack`, a zipped TextBundle) — the Markdown-with-assets container
//  Ulysses, iA Writer and Bear write. A bundle is `text.md` (or
//  `text.markdown`), an `info.json` declaring the type, and an `assets/`
//  folder of images.
//
//  Scope, stated honestly so the iOS and Android siblings match it: md's
//  document model is a single `String` and the preview has never shown a
//  local image, so the round-trip here is *text*, not pictures.
//
//   • Import loads a bundle's / pack's `text.md` as the editable document
//     (see `MarkdownDocument.init`). The `assets/` images are read but not
//     retained — the document is only the text — so a bundle carrying images
//     opens with its `![](assets/…)` refs showing as broken images in the
//     preview. That is the same honest failure a missing file already is, and
//     it still lets the author edit the prose. Wiring imported asset bytes
//     into the preview's scheme handler is the one thing md wholly lacks and
//     is deliberately *not* built here (it would have to thread asset storage
//     through the value-type document, the preview and all three platforms).
//
//   • Export writes the current document as a `.textbundle`, copying any
//     *findable* local images the Markdown references by relative path into
//     `assets/` and rewriting those refs. A ref that can't be found is left
//     exactly as the author wrote it — a broken ref stays a visible broken
//     ref, nothing vanishes silently.
//
//  This file is the byte-for-byte sibling of the iOS `TextBundle.swift`; the
//  one difference is encoding detection, which runs through this app's
//  `PlainTextCodec.decode` (the iOS app names the same logic
//  `MarkdownDocument.decode`). The pure pieces (the zip reader, `info.json`,
//  the ref rewrite, the bundle assembly) carry no WebKit and no disk I/O, so
//  they are unit-tested directly; the picker plumbing lives in
//  `DocumentExport`.
