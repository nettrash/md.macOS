//  The `FileDocument` that backs every editor window. A Markdown file is
//  just UTF-8 text, so the model is a single `String`. Reading and
//  writing therefore reduce to "decode the bytes" / "encode the string"
//  — no wrappers, no temp files, no security-scoped bookmarks; the
//  document architecture owns the file coordination on every platform.
